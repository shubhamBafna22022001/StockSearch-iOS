## Technologies & Architecture

- **SwiftUI 5** + **MVVM** for a clean, reactive UI.

## Challenges Faced

1. **Asynchronous Data & Performance**  
   Used `@Published` properties, debouncing, and background threads to ensure smooth UI updates.

2. **WKWebView Integration**  
   Bridged SwiftUI and UIKit to embed **Highcharts** for hourly/historical stock data.

3. **Robust Error Handling**  
   Handled invalid inputs, insufficient funds/shares, and network errors without crashing.

## Conclusion

**StockSearch-iOS** showcases my ability to create a production-ready iOS application with SwiftUI, leveraging real-time data and user-focused features. It integrates a robust backend (Node.js & MongoDB), provides a smooth user experience (animations, error handling, and data caching), and supports essential stock-tracking functionalities.
